## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To solve a logistics optimization problem using **Linear Programming (LP)** with Pythonâ€™s `PuLP` library. The goal is to **minimize total transportation cost** from multiple warehouses to customer locations while satisfying customer demand and not exceeding warehouse capacity.

---

Project Description: In this project, we solve a logistics optimization problem for a delivery company aiming to minimize transportation costs while ensuring all customer demands are met. The business has multiple warehouses and delivery locations, each with specific supply and demand values. 

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Description
We modeled the supply chain of a logistics company with:

- **2 Warehouses**: `W1`, `W2`
- **3 Customer Locations**: `C1`, `C2`, `C3`
- Each warehouse has a **fixed supply**
- Each customer has a **fixed demand**
- A **cost matrix** defines the cost per unit for each route (Warehouse â†’ Customer)

---

## ðŸ§® Optimization Formulation

- **Decision Variables**: `x[i][j]` = number of units shipped from warehouse `i` to customer `j`
- **Objective Function**:  
  Minimize total cost = âˆ‘ (cost[i][j] Ã— x[i][j])
- **Constraints**:
  - Shipments from a warehouse cannot exceed its supply
  - Each customerâ€™s demand must be fully met

---

The model includes constraints to ensure:

Supplies are not exceeded at warehouses

Demands are fulfilled at customer locations

Route costs are respected

Once solved, the notebook presents:

Optimal delivery routes 

Total minimum cost

Resource allocation

Business insights for strategic planning

Key Concepts Covered: Objective function formulation

Constraint modeling

Solving LP using PuLP

Business interpretation of the result

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used

- `pulp`
- `pandas`

## ðŸ’» Output

```
Status: Optimal

Optimal Routes and Quantities:
W1 -> C1: 0.0 units
W1 -> C2: 0.0 units
W1 -> C3: 100.0 units
W2 -> C1: 80.0 units
W2 -> C2: 70.0 units
W2 -> C3: 0.0 units

Total Minimum Transportation Cost: â‚¹810.0
```

## ðŸ“Š Business Insights

- ðŸ§  Warehouse **W2** should handle all deliveries to **C1** and **C2**, utilizing its full capacity.
- ðŸ“¦ Warehouse **W1** is best used for fulfilling all demand to **C3**.
- âœ… This route configuration **minimizes total delivery cost** to â‚¹810.
- ðŸš› Optimized logistics planning can reduce operational costs and improve supply chain efficiency.

---

## âœ… Conclusion

This project fulfills the internship requirement for **Task 4 â€“ Optimization Model** by:
- Formulating a real-world logistics problem
- Modeling constraints and objective function using Linear Programming
- Solving with Pythonâ€™s `PuLP` and interpreting the optimal strategy

The solution offers a practical decision-making tool for logistics cost savings.
